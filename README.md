# Customer-review-analysis

This notebook aims at extracting valuable insights from customers reviews. Data is based on coffee shop reviews collected in the Austin area.
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sripaadsrinivasan/yelp-coffee-reviews

In this notebook I use methods such as LSA and LDA to extract topics from the reviews. The most prevalent topics are then shortly discussed.
Word-clouds are also created in order to visualize the most important words.
